For model-driven, high risk decision-making tasks, quantifying prediction  uncertainty is as important as accuracy. Conformal prediction provides a principled way to quantify uncertainty in predictions by producing prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage. However, one of the major drawbacks of conformal predictions is that it requires that the data satisfy *exchangeability*. This assumption is often violated for real world data, specially panel data where exchangability can be violated because of cross-sectional heterogeneity and temporal data-drift.

We propose QUPEC (Quantifying Uncertainty in Panel data using Weighted Conformal Prediction), a framework to extend conformal prediction to non-exchangeable panel data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of QUPEC on four real-world datasets and show that QUPEC generates accurate prediction intervals with minimal loss in efficiency compared to standard variants of conformal prediction including time-weighted conformal prediction.
