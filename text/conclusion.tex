In this paper, we introduced QUPEC, a weighted conformal prediction framework designed to generate reliable prediction intervals for non-exchangeable panel data by incorporating both temporal and cross-sectional similarities. Our empirical evaluation across four real-world datasets demonstrates that QUPEC consistently achieves superior reliability, as measured by the coverage gap, compared to standard and time-weighted conformal methods.

The results confirm that while this enhanced reliability often involves a trade-off with wider, less efficient intervals, it is not a universal constraint. Notably, on the Elo dataset, QUPEC simultaneously improved both reliability and efficiency, highlighting its adaptability. The empirical results also reveal that purely time-weighted methods are often insufficient for panel data, as they fail to account for the underlying heterogeneity across entities. This underscores the critical importance of modeling cross-sectional dependencies, a key contribution of our proposed method.

However QUPEC necessitates the use of an extity similary measure $d_{entity}(i, i')$ to capture the cross-sectional similarities. This can be a bottleneck in practice. The choice of the hyperparameters $\beta_{time}$ and $\beta_{entity}$ is also dataset dependent and requires careful tuning. This can be another challenge for practitioners. Further work could focus on developing more sophisticated methods for learning the entity distance metric and exploring hyperparametert tuning efficiently using key attributes of the data like temporal and cross sectional correlations.
